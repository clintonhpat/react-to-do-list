## Reflection

  - This application was originally made in JavaScript to learn basic JavaScript functions and operations. It was later recreated in React to learn the utilization of React, JSX and React Hooks. This project was initiated by using the `create-react-app` boilerplate.

  - At the time, my biggest obstacles with this application were simply syntax errors as I had just started learning the structure of React, JavaScript, CSS, and HTML.

  - The technologies implemented in this project are React, React hooks, JSX, and CSS. The `create-react-app` boilerplate was chosen to minimize initial setup time to invest more time into learning the structure of the codebases.
